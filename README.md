# ecological-effects
Habitat area saved by a consumer choice or environmental action taken will be the output of this smartphone and computer app. 
App will motivate and empower people to take actions that benefit our biosphere. 
I have the algorithm and data tables. I use the results in my educational eco shows. A simple phone app version would be relatively easy to write - but a rad UI and/or a possible "multiplayer" version would be good. I have created a simple and working javascript for the "Habitat Area Potential Saved For One Year" output that I use.  I am a not-programmer.
